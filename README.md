- When a new match is started, it is added to the scoreboard with an initial score of 0 â€“ 0.
- Each match records the following parameters:
  - Home team name.
  - Away team name.
  - Initial score of 0 for both teams.
  - Start time to ensure uniqueness, even for matches started at the same millisecond.
- Scores are updated as absolute values for both home and away teams.
- The update score feature receives a pair of absolute scores (home team score and away team score).
- A match in progress can be finished, and this removes the match from the scoreboard.
- Matches are displayed in a summary in the following order:
  - Descending order by total score (sum of home and away scores).
